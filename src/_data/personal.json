With each wood chip removed I uncover more of myself. When rolling the ink on a plate I unveil the full image, becoming a reality. Then I pass it through the press and slowly and, somewhat anxiously, I peel up the paper to uncover my final work. Even though these are repetitive movements I feel the excitement, surprise and relief with every piece."
